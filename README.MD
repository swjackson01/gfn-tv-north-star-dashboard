# GFNTV North Star Dashboard

This repository contains a high‑fidelity, static dashboard shell for the GFNTV AVOD/FAST opportunity defined in the Project Definition & Implementation (PDI) document.[file:1] It is designed as an executive **North Star** view of:

- Monthly ad revenue and progress toward the \$250k/month target.
- Video starts volume and supporting monetization factors.
- Fill rate, blended eCPM, and FAST endpoint performance.
- Device mix and a lightweight risks/opportunities panel.[file:1]

The layout is intentionally simple HTML/CSS so it can be deployed quickly and later upgraded to a full React/BI implementation.
